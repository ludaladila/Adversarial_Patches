# Adversarial_Patches

This repository contains the code and assets for an adversarial patch attack project. The objective is to force the model to misclassify any image containing the patch as a **"giant panda"** (ImageNet index 388).

## Creative Concept: The "Panda Water" Label

The creative component of this project was to test the patch's viability in a physical, real-world scenario. Instead of just using the raw "noise" patch, it was disguised as a product label for a fictional "Panda Mineral Water" brand.

## Repository Contents

* **`Adversarial_Patch_Attack.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code to generate the patch and run the visualizations.

    * `panda_patch_raw.png`: The final adversarial patch generated by the notebook.
    * `panda_water_label.png`: The creative label design that incorporates the adversarial patch.
    * `digital_test_success.jpg`: A screenshot showing the model being fooled by the *digitally-applied* patch.
    * `physical_test_failure.jpg`: A photo showing the model correctly identifying the *real bottle* with the printed patch.
